<h1>The Time Domain</h1>

<p>The pace of a messaging conversation mirrors in a general sense the pace of speech, if it were porportionally
    stretched in the horizontal time domain. While we use sentence-to-sentence pacing signifiers from traditional text
    (punctuation), there is a second, larger rhythmic structure at play here, the "meta-rhythm" measured in the amount
    of time between individual messages.</p>
<p>The instaneous nature of messaging articially re-inserts the overall meta-rhythm of a conversation as an underlying
    means of communication. We substitute the subtextual information contained in the rhythm of speech (measured in
    seconds, beats, breaths, and microscopic hesitations) for the corresponding subtextual information in the
    meta-rhythm of a message exchange (measured in minutes, hours, days, weeks, and months). Because messaging is
    instant, we hold the assumption (conciously or not) that all meta-rhythms in conversation are present by choice;
    designed by each participant, and purposefully containing premeditated subtext. Whether or not this is "truly" the
    case is irrelevant, our perception of its reality is what makes it an important component of our interpretation of
    messaging subtext. </p>
<p>These meta-rhythms are often used as perceived signifiers of our recipient's level of interest. An instant response
    might be percieved as a sign of overeagerness, of lust, desparation, or genuine excitement. A response with a 20
    minute wait time might show a more mature or leveled interest, or a slight dismissal. Response times measured in
    hours often begin to suggest larger overall dynamics of the social power relationship, especially if they are one
    sided, while response times of days or weeks may suggest a more sincere disinterest (or the opposite). Again, since
    we percieve the response time as a choice, each of these actions are seen as purposeful subtext provided by the
    sender. Like all subtext, meta-rhythms are extremely subtle and context dependant. They don't directly change
    anything, but over time they contribute to the lense through which we intepret the text itself contained in
    individual messages. </p>
<p>The binary call and response structure of a messaging conversation also serves to heighten the percieved gravity of
    each response gap, as we send one message, and wait in silence for a response. </p>
<p>Baudrillard reflects on how the instantaneous nature of communication can leave us with an odd sensation of empty
    time. While he speaks of telecommunication in the 1980s, this sentiment translates well to the fragmented nature of
    messaging </p>
<p>"And what about time, this vast leisure time we are left with, and which engulfed us like an empty terrain; an
    expanse rendered futile in its unfolding from the moment that the instantaneousness of communication miniaturizes
    our exchanges into a series of instants?"</p>
<p>Baudrillard's "series of instants" are phone calls, while our messaging conversations are abstracted and fragmented
    in an even higher order of magnitude. </p>
<h1>Seduction (not specific to time domain)</h1>
<p>In some sense, the vaugeness of these subtextual signifiers, their unreliability, serves to pique our interest even
    more. There is a sexual tension to the continued cycle of reading and rereading messages in the conquest for
    subtextual truth. We are seduced by the unkown, as Baudrillard says: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"there is nothing seductive about truth. Only the secret is seductive: the secret which circulates as the rule of
        the
        game, as an initiatory form, as a symbolic pact, which no code can resolve, no clue interpret."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Baudrillard further points out a key characteristic of subtext in all forms: it has no true meaning, no ultimate
    definition: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"The secret is never the repressed. It is never 'everything you don't know about and have always wanted to know
        about
        yourself and sex' (Woody Allen), it is that which no longer pertains to the order of truth ... An immediately
        contagious giddiness: seduction operates through the subtle pleasure which beings and things experience in
        remaining
        secret"</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So as messaging brings our attention to subtext that we (incorrectly) percieve as increasingly measurable and
    explicit, we devote a greater amount of our time and energy in the seductive realm of speculative interpretation.
</p>
<p>NOTE: This is in some ways the opposite of baudrillard's original ideas of what seduction is. I am taking the liberty
    here of reappropriating his work because I think these ideas are interesting when placed in this context, but please
    read the source and form you own opinions on it if you have any interest in further examination of Baudrillard's
    ideas</p>
